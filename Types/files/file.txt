The Chernobyl disaster was caused by a nuclear accident that occurred on Saturday 26 April 1986, at the No. 
4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR. 
It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and was caused by one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven the maximum severity on the International Nuclear Event Scale, 
the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan.

The accident started during a safety test on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor, which was commonly used throughout the Soviet Union. 
The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining reactor cooling water 
circulation until the back-up electrical generators could provide power. This gap was about one minute and had been identified 
as a potential safety problem that could cause the nuclear reactor core to overheat. It was hoped to prove that the residual 
rotational energy in a turbine generator could provide enough power to cover the gap. Three such tests had been conducted since 1982, 
but they had failed to provide a solution. On this fourth attempt, an unexpected 10-hour delay meant that an unprepared operating shift was on duty.

Best practices for data that we dont control
-An application has do control the outer data, we can't let unexpected null values to our inner application layer
-We can filter these type of data at the presentation layer
-We need to document our exposed methods to other users/clients, they should not send null values in their requests
-Also we need to validate parameters to fail fast
-After we detect a invalid null value, we can use a default value or throw a exception(null pointer exception or
illegal argument exception)

Best practices for data that we control
-Never pass null as argument
-Never return null
-Don't use optional parameters, instead use overloading
-Don't return null objects, use empty collections

Overview
    -The role of collections
    -Collections adn type safety
    -Common collection methods
    -Collections and entry equality
    -New collection methods in Java 9
    -Converting between collections and arrays
    -Common collections interface and classes
    -Sorting behavior
    -Map collections

Managing Groups of Data
    -We need to manage groups of data
    -Most basic solution is to use arrays

Arrays have limitations
    -Statically sized
    -Requires explicit position management
    -Little more than a bunch of values

    Collections provide more powerful options

The Role of Collections
    -Iterable
    -Can provide type safety
    -Tend to dynamically size

A wide variety of collections are available
    -May be simple list of values
    -Can provide optimization or sophistication
        *Ordering
        *Prevent duplicates
        *Manage data as name/value pairs

Collections and Type Safety

By default collections hold Object types
    -Must convert return values to desired type
    -Does not restrict types of values added

Collections can be type restricted
    -Uses the Java concept of generics
    -Type specific during collection creation

Collection type restriction is pervasive
    -Return values appropriately typed
    -Adding values limited to appropriate type

Collection Interface
-Each collection type has its own features, but there are many that are common
-Collection interface
    *Provides common collection methods
    *Implemented by most collection types
        >Map collections are notable exception
    *Extends iterable interface

Common Collection Methods

Method      Description
size        number of elements
clear       remove all elements
isEmpty     return true if no elements
add         add single element
addAll      add all members of another collection
contains    return true if contains element
containsAll return true if contains all members of another collection
remove      remove element
removeAll   remove all elements contained in another collection
retainAll   remove all elements not contained in another collection

Java8 Collection Methods
-Java8 introduces lambda expressions, simplify passing code as arguments
-Collection methods that leverage lambdas
    *forEach:perform code for each member
    *removeIf:remove element if test is true

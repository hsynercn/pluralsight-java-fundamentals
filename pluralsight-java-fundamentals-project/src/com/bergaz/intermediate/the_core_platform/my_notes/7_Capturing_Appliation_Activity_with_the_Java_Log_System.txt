Log System
-We need a way to capture app activity
    *Record errors
    *Track usage info
    *Debug

The required level of detail can vary
-Sometimes we need lots of details
    *Newly deployed app
    *Too many error
-Generally we need less detail
    *App becomes mature
-Java provides a built-in solution
    *java.util.logging

Log System Management
-Log system is centrally managed
    *There is one app-wide log manager
    *Manages log system configuration
    *Manages objects that do the actual logging
-Represented by LogManager class
    *One global instance
    *Access with static method LogManager.getLogManager

Making Log Calls
-Logger class, provides logging methods
-We access Logger instances with LogManager
    -getLogger method
    -Each instance named
    -A global logger instance is available, we can get it by Logger class' static field GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME
